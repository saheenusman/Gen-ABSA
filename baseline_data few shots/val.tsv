Text: I go to a part 141 flight training program and they do stage checks. I've completed the private pilot program and am currently working on the instrument program. I have been unsat on 3 stage checks so far, but I haven't failed a Checkride. (I only took the ppl checkride so far and passed first try). My end goal is to work at the major airlines, but now I'm worried that none of them will accept me as a pilot because of these failures. Do any of you know if airlines even ask about these stage check failures and if it's already too late for me to try to pursue this career? Has anyone gone through similar situations? I've already committed so much into this career but is it even worth continuing if I don't have a chance at a job in the future? Also, with the way hiring is slowing down right now, I feel like you'd have to be the most perfect pilot in order to find a job these days. I'm still maybe 2 years out from applying for jobs, but the thought is stressing me out.
